# cad_rve_fusion360
Generate representative volume elements by python scripting in cad software of fusion360

### summary

Fusion 360 provides the application programe interface (API) for parametric design where Python and C++ programming language are allowed.

For the RVE for simulation of composite materials, the random spatial distribution must be generated by iterative process.

Python scripting is employed to facilitate this process through API of fusion 360.
